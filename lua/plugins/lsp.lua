        -- Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
        --
        -- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
        --
        -- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
        -- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
        --
        -- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
        -- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
        -- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
        -- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
        --
        -- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
        --  - Go to definition
        --  - Find references
        --  - Autocompletion
        --  - Symbol Search
        --
        -- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
        -- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
        --
        -- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully
        -- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`

        --  This function gets run when an LSP attaches to a particular buffer.
        --    That is to say, every time a new file is opened that is associated with
        --    an lsp (for example, opening `main.rs` is associated with `rust_analyzer`) this
        --    function will be executed to configure the current buffer
